# Bit Manipulation

## Introduction 

An integer is stored in computer as a sequence of bits. So, we can use integer data types (like `int` and `float`) to represent a lightweight small set of boolean values. All set operations then involve only bitwise manipulation of the corresponding integer, which makes it a much more efficient choice when compared to using an array of boolean variables.

You need to familiarise yourself with binary representation of data before proceeding further. Go through the following links to catch up if you are not familiar with booean algebra.

## Bitwise Operations:

Most bitwise operations are practically $O(1)$ (to be precise, they are $O(number of bits)$). Keep in mind that the value of some of these operations will depend on whether you're using a 32-bit (`int`) data type or 64-bit (`long`) data type.

 1. The bitwise NOT operation:
   
    Using `~` on any integer flips all its bits. 
    
    ```
    P = 14 : 1110
    _____________

    ~P = 1  : 0001
    ```
  
 2. The bitwise OR operation:
   
    Using `|` on two numbers as operands performs a logical 'OR' operation on all the coresponding bits. The resulting bit is 1 if either of the operands' corresponding bits are 1 and 0 otherwise.
       
    ```
    P   = 10 : 1010
    Q   = 9  : 1001
    _______________
    
    P|Q = 11 : 1011
    ```

 3. The bitwise AND operation:
   
    Using `&` on two numbers as operands performs a logical 'AND' operation on all the coresponding bits. The resulting bit is 1 if both the operands' corresponding bits are 1 and 0 otherwise.
  
    ```
    P   = 10 : 1010
    Q   = 9  : 1001
    _______________
  
    P&Q = 8  : 1000
    ```
   
 4. The bitwise XOR operation:
   
    Using `^` on two numbers as operands performs a logical 'XOR' operation on all the coresponding bits. The resulting bit is 1 if the operands' corresponding bits are different and 0 otherwise.
  
    ``` 
    P   = 10 : 1010
    Q   = 9  : 1001
    _______________
    
    P^Q = 3  : 0011
    ```
  
 5. The bitshift operations:
   
    Using right shift `>>` and left shift `<<` on a pair of operands performs a bitshifting operation on the first operand by the numbere of places denoted by the second operand. 
  
    ``` 
    P    = 10 : 01010
    Q    = 1   
    _______________
    P>>Q = 5  : 00101
    P<<Q = 20 : 10100
    ```

## Cool bit tricks:

C++ (`g++` in specific) also has a few other inbuilt functions related to bit manipulation:

- `__builtin_clz(x)` counts number of leading zeroes
- `__builtin_ctz(x)` counts number of trailing zeroes
- `__builtin_popcount(x)` counts number of ones (set bits)

Note that these are only for the `int` data type, use `__builtin_clzl` for `long` and `__builtin_clzll` for `long long`.

Here are some cool things you can do using bitwise operations:
- Check Parity:

  A number is odd iff its rightmost bit (LSB) is 1, which means ANDing it with 1 should give you 1. For even numbers, the rightmost bit is 0 and so ANDing with 1 will give 0.
  ```cpp
  bool isOdd(int x) {
    return x & 1;
  }
  ```

- Multiplication & Division:
   
  To multiply or divide an integer by $2^k$, we only need to shift all bits $k$ times to the left / right respectively. Note that truncation in the shift right operation automatically rounds the division down (floor division). 

  ```   
  P    =   44 (base 10) = 0101100 (base 2) 
  P<<1 =   88 (base 10) = 1011000 (base 2)
  P>>1 =   22 (base 10) = 0010110 (base 2)
  P>>2 =    5 (base 10) = 0000101 (base 2)
  ```  
   
- Checking if the $i$ th bit is set :
   
  Bitwise AND operation can be used to check the state of bits in general. We can AND with $2^i$ and it will give 0 if the bit is not set and will give $2^i$ if the bit is set:

  ```   
  P    =   44 (base 10) = 0101100 (base 2) 
  i    =    4 (base 10)
  X    = 1<<i           = 0010000 (base 2)
  ________________________________________
  Q    =  P&X           = 0000000 (base 2)  
  ``` 
   
- Setting the $i$ th bit:
   
  Bitwise OR operation can be used to set bits in general. For the $i$ th bit from the right, we can OR with $2^i$ which is the same as `1<<i`:
  
  ``` 
  P    =   44 (base 10) = 0101100 (base 2) 
  i    =    4 (base 10)
  X    = 1<<i           = 0010000 (base 2)
  ________________________________________
  
  P | X =                 0111100 (base 2)
  ```
  
- Unsetting the $i$ th bit:

  Bitwise AND operation using the complement can be used to unset bits in general. For the $i$ th bit from the right, we can AND with the complement of `1<<i`:
   
  ```
  P    =      44 (base 10) = 0101100 (base 2) 
  i    =       3 (base 10)
  X    = ~(1<<i)           = 1110111 (base 2)
  _______________________________________
  P & X                      0100100 (base 2)  
  ```   

- Toggling the $i$ th bit:
   
  Bitwise XOR operation is used to toggle bits in general. To toggle the state of the $i$ th bit, XOR it with `1<<i`. 
   
  ```
  P    =   44 (base 10) = 0101100 (base 2) 
  i    =    4 (base 10)
  X    = 1<<i           = 0010000 (base 2)
  ________________________________________
  P^X                   = 0111100 (base 2)  
   
- Check if an integer is a power of two:

  A power of two will always have exactly one set bit. To check if a positive integer is a power of two, we can check if `x & (x - 1)` is equal to 0. Note that the x = 0 has to be handled separately.
