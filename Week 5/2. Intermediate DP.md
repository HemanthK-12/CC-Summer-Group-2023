# Intermediate DP

## Using DP with other techniques

For many problems, after figuring out the DP approach, we'll need to make some observations and optimise it using other techniques like prefix sums, binary search or other data structures.

Consider this problem: given a set of $n$ projects with start date $s_i$, end date $e_i$ and reward $w_i$, what is the maximum reward you can earn if you can attend atmost one project in a day?

Take $dp_i$ to be the maximum reward you can earn doing till the $i$ th project. We have two options:
- We don't do the $i$ th project.
- If we're doing the $i$ th project, we can only do other projects that have end date $e_j$ before its start date $s_i$.

$$ dp_i = max(dp_{i-1}, w_i + \max_{e_j < s_i}{(dp_j)}) $$

We can sort the projects in ascending order of $e_i$ to allow us to stop checking once $e_j >= s_i$. Still, the time complexity of this approach is $O(n^2)$ since the $max$ calculation takes $O(n)$.

To optimise this, we notice that $dp_i$ is non-decreasing: as we get more available projects, our maximum reward cannot decrease, it will either stay the same or increase. 

This means we can use binary search to find the maximum $j$ such that $e_j < s_i$ and then use the corresponding $dp_j$ for the $max$ calculation, which only takes $O(log n)$. This makes the overall time complexity $O(n log n)$.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
typedef long long ll;
int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    // start, end, reward
    vector<array<ll, 3>> arr(n);
    for (auto &i : arr)
        cin >> i[0] >> i[1] >> i[2];
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [](auto &i, auto &j) {
        return i[1] < j[1];
    });
    vector<ll> end(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        end[i] = arr[i][1];
    vector<ll> dp(n, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int j = lower_bound(end.begin(), end.end(), arr[i][0]) - end.begin() - 1;
        dp[i] = max((i ? dp[i - 1] : 0), (j >= 0 ? dp[j] : 0) + arr[i][2]);
    }
    cout << dp[n - 1] << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```


## Bitmask DP

One common technique that can be used when certain parameters are small is using a bitmask as one of the dimensions of the DP array.

For example, consider this problem: given the prices of $k$ products over $n$ days, what is the minimum total price we need to pay if we can buy atmost one product in a day?

Let `price[i][j]` denote the price of the $i$ th product on day $j$. We take `dp[mask][i]` as the required minimum total price for buying a subset of the products denoted by $mask$ in $i$ days.

For `dp[mask][i]`, on day $i$, we can either not buy any product or buy some product $x$ that belongs to the $mask$, which gives us:

$$ dp(mask, i) = min(dp(mask, i - 1), \min_{x \in mask}{(dp(mask \\ x, i - 1) + price[x][i])}) $$

```cpp
int main()
{
    int k, n;
    cin >> k >> n;
    int prices[k][n];
    for (auto &i : prices)
    {
        for (auto &j : i)
            cin >> j;
    }
    int dp[1 << k][n];
    for (int x = 0; x < k; x++)
        dp[1 << x][0] = price[x][0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << k); mask++)
        {
            dp[mask][i] = dp[mask][i - 1];
            for (int x = 0; x < k; x++)
            {
                if (mask & (1 << x))
                    dp[mask][i] = min(dp[mask][i], dp[mask ^ (1 << x)][i - 1] + price[x][i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this is $O(n \cdot 2 ^ k \cdot k)$.

Now, we can only represent bitmasks of upto 64 bits using a `long long` variable but we can use the `bitset` STL data structure to represent longer bitsets:

```cpp
// creates a bitset of length 8 with all bits 0
bitset<8> b1;

// we can initialise it with the binary representation of a number
bitset<16> b2(69);
bitset<16> b3("010100111");

// they can be printed directly!
cout << b1 << "\n" << b2 << "\n" << b3 << "\n";

// it behaves similar to a boolean array / vector
for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++)
    cout << b1[i];
b2[0] = b1[0] ^ b3[1]

// it supports all normal bitwise operations (&, ^, |, <<, >>) as long as both operands have same size
b2 &= b3;
bitset<16> b4 = b2 << 4;
```

The main disadvantage of `bitset` is that its **size must be known at compile-time**, which means that you cannot intialise the size to some non-constant variable.

Internally, the implementation of `bitset` can be thought of as the compiler splitting the bitstring into chunks of 64 bits and performing the required operations on these chunks as normal numbers.

This means that most bitwise operations on `bitset` have time complexity $O (n / 64)$ where $n$ is the length of the bitset. This means that using `bitset` is around 64x faster than a regular boolean array most of the time.

While you might be confused as to why we mention the $64$ despite it being a constant factor that should be ignored in time complexity, don't forget that at the end of the day, we're not just theoretically analysing algorithms, we're practically implementing them as well and large constant factors like this cannot be ignored in certain cases.

For example, there have been DP problems where a regular $O(n^2)$ gave TLE but a `bitset` optimised $O(n^2 / 64)$ managed to just squeeze under the time limit and give AC.
