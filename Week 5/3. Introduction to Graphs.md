# Introduction to Graphs

Graphs and networks are one of the most natural ways in which humans analyse real world problems because modelling many problems as a network can simplify the problem.

You will understand how powerful graph theory is when you apply it in multiple problems through your CP journey. However, before we dwell into the concepts of graph theory, let's look into some terminolgy that will be used in further sections. 

## Parts of a Graph

Any graph is a set of 2 components. 
- Nodes (or vertices)
- Edges

Edges connect nodes with each other. Consider a map of highways connecting cities. Each highway is an edge and each city is a node. 

## Types of Graphs

Graphs can be of many types and so are categorised by many parameters. We'll illustrate the most commonly used ones.

You can visualize them on [this website](https://visualgo.net/en/graphds?slide=1). You may also play around with the parameters to understand better. 

- **Directed and Undirected Graphs**
   
  Graphs in which each edge has a direction (unidirectional) are known as directed graphs, whereas, a graph in which edges don't have a direction (can also be thought of as bidirectional) is known as an undirected graph.
   
  Direction of an edge refers to the direction in which it can be travelled, i.e $A \rightarrow B$ is a directed edge from A to B such that one may go from A to B through that edge but not the other way round.
  
  $A \leftrightarrow B$ is an undirected edge.

  Some basic terminology associated with the system of nodes and edges are:
  - Number of edges incident to a node is called degree of the node.
  - Number of edges going into a node in a directed graph is known as its indegree.
  - Number of edges going out of a node in a directed graph is known as its outdegree.

  The terms indegree and outdegree only makes sense for a directed graph.

- **Weighted and Unweighted Graphs**
  
  Graphs in which each edge has weight/value/cost associated with it are called weighted graphs and graphs in which edges do not have a weight/value/cost are knowns as unweighted graphs.

- **Cyclic And Acyclic Graphs**
  
  A cycle in a graph is a sequence of nodes such that you can start from any node of the cycle and end up at the starting node without tranversing the same edge twice. A graph with atleast one cyle is a cyclic graph, otherwise it is acyclic.

- **Simple and Complete Graphs**

  A graph without cycles and with at most one edge between any two nodes is called a simple graph. If there is an edge between all pairs of nodes, the graph is called a complete graph.

- **Bipartite Graphs**

  A bipartite graph is a graph whose nodes can be partitioned into two sets such that each edge is from one set to another and no edge connects nodes in the same set.

- **Trees**
  
  An undirected, acyclic and connected graph is known as a Tree. Trees are incredibly important in competitive programming - many algorithms you'll learn are based on trees, and many problems you will encounter will involve trees.

  Trees are special because of the following features :
  - A tree with $n$ nodes has $n-1$ edges.
  - Any node can be reached from another node through an unique path.

## Graph Terminology

-  The nodes in a directed tree with indegree 0 is called the root node.
-  In an undirected tree, any node can be made a root node by anchoring the tree about that node.
-  Nodes below node X become its children and X is the parent of those nodes.
-  Nodes without children are leaf nodes.
-  Nodes at the same heirarchial level under a parent node are sibling nodes.
-  Any node on the path between node X and the root is an ancestor of X.
-  The number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf is called height of the tree.
-  In a rooted tree, node X and all the nodes below X form the subtree of X.

## Representation of Graphs

There are 3 main ways we represent graphs in CC:

- **Adjacency Matrix**

  If the number of vertices $V$ is small enough, we can build a static 2D array `int AM[V][V]` with $O(V^2)$ space complexity. 

  For an unweighted graph, set `AM[u][v]` to a non-zero value (usually 1) if there is an edge between vertex `u-v` and zero otherwise. 

  For a weighted graph, set `AM[u][v] = weight(u, v)` if there is an edge between vertex `u-v` with `weight(u, v)` and zero otherwise.

  This is useful for small and dense graphs but is not recommended for large sparse graphs as it would require too much space and there would be many blank cells in the 2D array. 

  Another drawback is that it also takes $O(V)$ time to enumerate the list of neighbors of any vertex — an operation common to many graph algorithms — even if that vertex only has a handful of neighbors.

  ```cpp
  void makegraph() {
      int V = 0, E = 0;
      cin >> V >> E;
      int adj_matrix[V + 1][V + 1];
      for(int i = 1; i <= V; i++) {
          for(int j = 1; j <= V; j++) {
              adj_matrix[i][j] = 0;
          }
      }
      
      for(int i = 1; i <= E; i++) {
          int node1, node2;
          cin >> node1 >> node2;
          adj_matrix[node1][node2] = 1;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Adjacency List**

  In an adjacency list, we have a 2D vector of pairs, where `list[u]` stores pairs `(v, w)` where `v` is a neighbour of `u` and `w` is the weight of the edge that connects them. If the graph is unweighted, we can just ignore the weight completely. 

  Adjacency lists offer a space complexity of $O(V+E)$. These are more space efficient than adjacency matrices but do not offer then same $O(1)$ lookup time for the existence of an edge between any pair of vertices. 
  
  Despite this, the space efficiency and quick access to any node's neighbours make adjacency lists the most common way of representing graphs.

  ```cpp
  void makegraph() {
      int V = 0, E = 0;
      cin >> V >> E;
      vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> list(V+1);
      for(int i = 1; i <= E; i++) {
          int node1, node2, weight;
          cin >> node1 >> node2 >> weight; 
          list[node1].push_back({node2, w});
          // if undirected, we would also do `list[node2].push_back({node1, w});`
      }
  }
  ```

- **Edge List**

  Here, we simply store a list of all E edges, with a space complexity of O(E). 
  
  This is used rarely only for some specific algorithms that involve sorting the edges in a particular order (one good example is Kruskal's MST algorithm).

  ```cpp
  void makegraph() {
      int V = 0, E = 0;
      cin >> V >> E;
      pair<int, int> edge_list[E];

      for(int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
          int node1, node2;
          cin >> node1 >> node2;
          edge_list[i] = {node1, node2};
      }
  }
  ```
