# Basic Math
## Modular Arithmetic:
   
In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, which is called the modulus. This means that a "modulo $m$" system has only $m$ numbers: $0, 1 ... m - 1$.

Meanwhile in programming, the modulo operator `a % b` calculates the remainder on dividing `a` by `b`. Most elementary properties of modular arithmetic are quite obvious:
- $`(a + b) \, mod \, m \equiv (a \, mod \, m + b \, mod \, m) \, mod \, m`$
- $`(a - b) \, mod \, m \equiv (a \, mod \, m - b \, mod \, m) \, mod \, m`$
- $`(a \cdot b) \, mod m \equiv (a \, mod \, m \cdot b \, mod \, m) \, mod \, m`$

Often in competitive coding, you will come across problems in which the input constraint would be such that the output exceeds even $10^{18}$! And such problems often ask you to output the answer modulo m where m is a large number like $10^9+7$. In such scenarios, you would require modular arithmetic to compute the answer efficiently and accurately.  
   
Given 3 numbers $p$, $q$ and $m$, we may need to compute the value of $p^q mod m$. However, if $q$ is very large ($\approx 10^{18}$), simply multiplying $p$ with itself $q$ times (while taking modulo) will be too inefficient as the time complexity is $O(q)$.

Instead, notice this property:
- $`p^2 \, mod \, m \equiv (p)^2 \, mod \, m`$
- $`p^4 \, mod \, m \equiv (p^2)^2 \, mod \, m`$
- $`p^8 \, mod \, m \equiv (p^4)^2 \, mod \, m`$

...and so on.

So, we can calculate $p^k$ where $k$ is a power of 2 simply by repeated squaring.

Since $a^{b+c} = a^b \cdot a^c$, if we can write $q$ as a sum of some powers of 2, we could multiply the corresponding values from the squaring (while taking modulo) and get our answer.

Since the binary representation of $q$ tells us exactly that, we can go over each bit from right to left, multiply the current power value if the bit is set and update the power value by squaring it.

Since our loop goes over each bit of $q$ once and the number of bits in $x$ is approximately $`log \, x`$, the time complexity of this approach is $`O(log \, x)`$.

## Primes and Factors:

### Sieve of Eratosthenes: 

Given a number $n$, we can find all prime numbers smaller than $n$ using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

The algorithm works on the principle that multiples of a prime are not prime numbers. We first mark every number as a prime and then iterate over them. If a number is marked as a prime, we mark all of its multiples as being not prime. 

While the below implementation may seem like an $O(n^2)$ algorithm because of the two nested loops, its actual time complexity is $`O(n \, log(log \, n)))`$  ([here](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/sieve-of-eratosthenes.html#asymptotic-analysis) is the derivation if you're interested).

You can use this to precompute all primes (up to a certain number) and then use them for every test case/query with $O(1)$ access time.

```cpp
// prime[i] = 1 if prime, 0 if not
// first, we mark everything as prime
vector<bool> prime (n+1, 1);
prime[1] = 0;
prime[0] = 0;
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
{
    if (!prime[i]) continue;
    // Here, we know i is prime
    // The multiples of i below i^2 would have already been marked previously under the other prime factor (that would be smaller than i) and so we start marking from i^2
    for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
        prime[j] = 0;
}
```

# prime[i] = True if prime, False if not
# first, we mark everything as prime
n = 100
prime = [True] * (n + 1)
prime[0] = False

for i in range(2, n + 1):
    if not prime[i]:
        continue
    # Here, we know i is prime
    # The multiples of i below i^2 would have already been marked previously under the other prime factor (that would be smaller than i) and so we start marking from i^2
    j = i * i
    while j <= n:
        prime[j] = False
        j += i
```

### Prime Factorisation : 

Every positive integer $n$ can be expressed in the form of: 
$$n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} ... p_i^{a_i}$$
where $p_i$ is a prime number and $a_i$ is a positive integer.

A simple way of computing the prime factors of $n$ can be done by repeatedly dividing $n$ by its smallest factor. Since it is impossible that all prime factors of $n$ are bigger than 
$\sqrt{n}$, we only need to test factors till $\sqrt{n}$, making the time complexity of this approach is $O(\sqrt{n})$.

    {
	    // as long as it is a factor, repeatedly divide it out

            n /= i;
        }
    }
    // if we could not find any factors from 2 to sqrt(n), the number itself is prime

        i += 1
    # if we could not find any factors from 2 to sqrt(n), the number itself is prime
    if n > 1: 
        pf.append(n)
    return pf

### LCM and GCD: 

Given two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $c = gcd(a,b)$ and $d = lcm(a,b)$, then :  
$$a \cdot b = c \cdot d$$

The Euclidean algorithm for finding $gcd(a,b)$ is 

```math

\text{gcd}(a, b) =
\begin{cases}
    a & \text{if } b = 0 \\
    \text{gcd}(b, a \bmod b) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}


```

GCD and LCM computations are quite common in many competitive coding problems owing to their vast applications.

## Binomial Coefficients:
The binomial coefficient, which is denoted be $n \choose k$, is the number of ways of choosing k elements from a set of n elements. Combinatorics problems often involve manipulating the properties of binomial systems to calculate outputs in the most efficient way. Some of the key properties are:

```math
{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k} \\
and \\
{n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}  
```

This recursive nature can be used to compute the binomial coefficients of a required system: 

<details>
<summary><b>C++ Implementation</b></summary>
  
```cpp
int choose(int n, int k)
{
    // n choose 0 = n choose n = 1
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    return choose(n - 1, k - 1) + choose(n - 1, k);      
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Python Implementation</b></summary>
  
```py
def choose(n, k):
    # n choose 0 = n choose n = 1
    if k == 0 or k == n: 
        return 1
    return choose(n - 1, k - 1) + choose(n - 1, k)
```
</details>

However, this method is will fail after about $n = 20$. Better methods that are required to compute the same will be explored in further sections.
