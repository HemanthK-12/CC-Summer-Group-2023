# Brute Force

## What is it?

<p>Brute force is an approach of problem-solving that involves examining every potential solution to a problem.</p>
<p>It is generally used in problems where you are asked to count the number of solutions or find the 'best' solution when the input size is quite small.</p>
<p>Writing a brute force algorithm does not require a lot of logic building as it is the most simple and naive way of solving a particular problem.</p>

## Number of subarrays with even sum

### Problem Statement

<p>You are given an array consisting of <code>n</code> integers.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the number of subarrays of the array whose sum is even.</p>
<p>Note that a subarray of an array is a contiguous section of an array that can be obtained by deleting elements at the beginning and at the end of the array.</p>

### Sample Case

<p>Let us take the array <code>[3, 7, 2, 6, 3, 4]</code>.</p>
<p><code>[7, 2, 6, 3]</code> is one subarray of this array whose sum is even.</p>
<p>Our task is to write a program that calculates the total number of such subarrays.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the answer for this particular array is <code>9</code>.</p>

### Solution

<p>The first step is to input the size of the original array and the values it contains.</p>
<p>We declare a variable <code>result</code> that keeps track of the number of even sum subarrays.</p>
<p>This is initialised to <code>0</code> as we have not examined any subarrays yet.</p>
<p>As we are writing a brute force algorithm, we must examine every possible subarray of the array and count the number of subarrays whose sum is even.</p>
<p>To iterate over every subarray, we use a nested for loop.</p>
<p>The outer loop goes through every value for the start index of the subarray (<code>l</code> from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>) and the inner loop goes through every corresponding possible values for the end index (<code>r</code> from <code>i</code> to <code>n</code>).</p>
<p>Another loop is written to calculate the sum of the subarray - that is the sum of the elements in the array from index <code>l</code> to <code>r</code>.</p>
<p>If the sum happens to be even, <code>result</code> is incremented by <code>1</code>, else it is left unchanged.</p>
<p>The code which is an implementation of this solution to the problem is given below.</p>

```cpp
void solve () {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int array [n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
        cin >> array [i];
    }
    int result = 0;
    for (int l = 0; l < n; l ++) {
        for (int r = l; r < n; r ++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = l; i <= r; i ++) {
                sum += array [i];
            }
            if (sum % 2 == 0) {
                result++;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << result << '\n';
}
```

<summary><b>Python Implementation</b></summary>

```py
def solve ():
    n = int (input ())
    array = list (map (int, input ().split (' ')))
    result = 0
    for l in range (n):
        for r in range (l, n):
            sum = 0
            for i in range (l, r + 1):
                sum += arr [i]
            if sum % 2 == 0:
                result += 1
    print (result)
```

</details>

To calculate the time complexity of the code, we see that the `l` and `r` loops will together run in $O(n^2)$ (to be precise, the number of iterations will be $n * (n - 1) / 2$, but we can ignore constants and lower order terms). 

The innermost loop that calculates the `sum` will (in the worst case) run in $O(n)$, making the total time complexity $O(n^3)$. (bonus: can you think of an algorithm to solve it in $O(n^2)$?)

## Number of Fibonacci sequences

### Problem statement

<p>In this problem, you have to find the number of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci sequences</a> of length <code>n</code> and ending with the element <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>A Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of non-decreasing positive integers defined by two starting elements (<code>a<sub>1</sub> ≤ a<sub>2</sub></code>) and the relation <code>a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i-1</sub> + a<sub>i-2</sub></code> for <code>i ≥ 3</code>.</p>

### Sample case

<p>Let us take <code>n = 6</code> and <code>k = 40</code>.</p>
<p>There are two valid sequences that can be constructed for these parameters, and they have beens listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0, 8, 8, 16, 24, 40</code></li>
<li><code>5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, the answer to this case is <code>2</code>.</p>

### Solution

<p>One way to approach this problem is to iterate over the possible values for the first two elements and construct the corresponding sequence.</p>
<p>However, this is not ideal as there is no upper bound for the values that the two elements can take and this will result in high time complexity.</p>
<p>The best alternative is to instead iterate over the values that the second-last element can take on.</p>
<p>The values that it can take on are all integers from <code>0</code> to <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>Using the last two elements, the sequence is constructed backwards using the relation <code>a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i+2</sub> - a<sub>i+1</sub></code> for <code>0 ≤ i ≤ n - 2</code>.</p>
<p>If the constructed sequence is valid (non-decreasing with no negative integers), the sequence is considered as a possible solution.</p>

        array [n - 1] = k;
        array [n - 2] = i;
        bool valid = true;
        for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; j --) {
            array [j] = array [j + 2] - array [j + 1];
            if (array [j] < 0 || array [j] > array [j + 1]) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (valid) {
            result++;
        }
    }
    cout << result << '\n';
}
```

def solve ():
    n, k = tuple (map (int, input ().split (' ')))
    result = 0
    for i in range (k + 1):
        array = [0] * n
        array [n - 1] = k
        array [n - 2] = i
        valid = True
        for j in range (n - 2, -1, -1):
            array [j] = array [j + 2] - array [j + 1]
            if array [j] < 0 or array [j] > array [j + 1]:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            result += 1
    print (result)
```

</details>

Looking at the code, the time complexity is clearly $O(k \cdot n)$.

## Note

<p>While brute force algorithms are very easy to implement most of the time as they do not require a lot of thinking, sometimes you will need to make some clever observations to simplify your implementation.</p>
<p>However, the downside to using brute force algorithms is that they take a lot of time to execute, resulting in a high chance that your code gets the <code>Time Limit Exceeded</code> verdict.</p>
<p>Brute force algorithms generally work for easy problems, but as you move towards solving tougher problems with tighter constraints, you will need to find better algorithms.</p>
<p>In general, <b>before coding anything, plan out your solution and calculate its time complexity. Based on the input size (and the rule of thumb about execution time), you will know if your approach will TLE or not.</b></p>
