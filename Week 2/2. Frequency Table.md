# Frequency Table

Frequency tables are generally used to keep track of how many times a certain element occurs within a set of elements.

To calculate this, we can use a `vector` `cnt` where `cnt[i] = number of occurences of i`. We can compute the `cnt1` values with a basic for loop:

```cpp
for (auto ele : arr)
  cnt[ele]++;
```

The only disadvantage of this approach is that the size of the `cnt` array must be greater than the maximum element, which can be a problem when the elements are upto $10^9$.

Also, it should be obvious that a lot of space is wasted since most indices of `cnt` will hold zero (especially when its size is large).

## `map`

To help with this, C++ has a `map` data structure, which allows you to **store any type of key-value pair in $O(n)$ space**, where $n$ is the numnber of key-value pairs.

The main disadvantage is that instead of read and write operations being $O(1)$ (constant time), each of these operations is $O(log n)$.

Here's how you use it:

```cpp
// you define it as map<type_of_key, type_of_value> variable_name;
map<int, int> m;
// yup, they can be any type you want
map<vector<int>, string> interesting_map;
map<vector<vector<int>>, map<int, vector<string>>> surely_there_is_a_better_way_map;

// to insert a key-value pair:
m.insert({3, 2});
// to get the value of a key:
cout << m[3] << "\n";  // 2

// the array-index notation is a reference and can be used to update a value quickly
m[3] += 5;
cout << m[3] << "\n";  // 7
// if the key doesn't exist, simply mentioning the array index notation somewhere will create it with a default value
cout << m[-3] << "\n"; // 0

// if you don't want this, use m.find(...)
if (m.find(4) != m.end())
{
  // element found
}
else
{
  // element not found
}
```

<br>

## `set`

Another cool data structure in C++ is the `set`, which only stores unique values. Like the `map`, you can insert, remove or check if a particular element is present in $O(log n)$.

Here's how you use it:

```cpp
// set<element_type> variable_name;
set<int> s;
set<string> dictionary;

// insert an element
s.insert(5)
// inserting an element that is already present does nothing
s.insert(5)

// to check if an element is present, use .count
cout << s.count(5) << "\n"  // 1
// remove an element
s.erase(5);
cout << s.count(5) << "\n"  // 0
```

Another cool thing about `set` and `map` is that elements are not stored in a random order or in the order of insertion: **they are usually always sorted in ascending order** (for map, key is considered for ordering). This is a very useful property that we will look at later.

## Example Problem: 2-SUM

You're given an array of $n$ elements and an integer $k$. 

Find the number of distinct pairs $(i, j)$ such that $a_i + a_j = k$.

The naive solution would be to loop over all possible $i$ and $j$ and count how many times the condition is satisfied.

However, the time complexity of this would be $O(n^2)$, which is too slow when $n \approx 10^5$.

Instead, we can construct the frequency map of the array and then loop over its key-value pairs (distinct element - its count).

For each value of the element (call it `x`), we look for the number of occurences of `k - x`. Then, we can add `res[x] * res[k - x]` to the answer since each occurence of `x` can pair with an occurence of `k - x` to form a pair with sum `k`.
